                      <p>We are a confident but humble team.  We realize that we are the stewards of our homeowner properties and their financial success.  Which means, we must be trustworthy, honorable, and sincere stewards in the care of our guests and their vacations stays, so memories and enjoyment are the lasting impression of their visit with a Five Star property.  We believe that stewardship starts with a readiness to serve.  We believe we have the most focused approach to revenue stewardship than any other vacation rental management company on the entire Texas coast.</p>

                      <p> We are confident, that the best way to predict the future is to look at the past.  The President and leader of Five Star Vacation Rentals, Inc. is an award winning hotelier that has 40 years of experience in leading hotels with revenue success, Franchise Excellent Ratings, Five Star Guest Service ratings, and experience of training up and coming leaders for the industry.  We believe that anyone running a company, regardless of their title, must lead from the front!  Our stewardship commitment also demands that we teach our employees the importance of leadership in leading their individual service teams.  Furthermore, to lead effectively, you have to have a documented tactical plan.  Our President and leader has written scores of marketing and successful business plans in her career.  Without a vision, a plan can’t take root and flourish.  We not only want to win, we PREPARE TO WIN!  Social Media is a winning segment of our overall tactical planning.  We use photos, virtual tours and even have our own YouTube Channel to showcase our products. We have our own Inhouse photographer, videographer, and data analysis expert on staff. </p>

                      <p>We are confident that our mission is to hire team members with the attitude and heartbeat to serve others.  Why?  Because we know we are still in the service industry.  In today’s workplace, so many functions are done by a computer.  There is an app for just about everything.  We certainly love our LiveRez booking engine.  With that said, we know that the soul of success is having a heart beat to serve others.  At the end of each working day, we ask each time member “did you make a difference today for someone”? We encourage our team members to go the extra mile when in contact with our guests. We think of them more as co-stars in a travel adventure. We are confident that happy guests return again to stay with us.   We believe a positive and uplifting attitude with the small things, carries over to the big things.</p>

                       We are confident in our mission to be good stewards of the assets that our homeowners allow us to book and care for them.  Our leadership has over 4 decades of experience analyzing and managing rate and inventory strategies based on strategic market data.  To be the best, we work on increasing our market share, we learn from past, present and projected trends in our market and capitalize on that data to deliver higher yields on rate and occupancy blends that deliver RevPar increases for our homeowner customers. Each month, we study what our Comp Set did, what the Area did, and what the Market did.  We compare that data to how we did. We never rest when it comes to rate and inventory management, Another key area of revenue success for us, is how we match and target specific market segments with rate and inventory in both high demand and low demand periods. Hotels have done this for years.  It works the same way for the vacation rental business.

We are confident and dedicated to our commitment to foster a company culture that attracts owners, guests, team members and community partners who want to do business with us. We believe that serving is not just an 8-5 ordeal, we know serving is a lifestyle.  After the office doors close for the day, you still have phone access to us 24 hours a day for emergencies.  Our work ethics are built around an old fashioned standard, that a man’s word is his bond, and a handshake still symbolizes honor, integrity, and commitment. We may not be able to change the world, but we want to make a difference in the guests and families that we meet and serve every day. What sets us apart, is our desire to offer service to others.                      </p>
